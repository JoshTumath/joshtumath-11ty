Ah, you made it! Welcome to my infrequently updated website!

I'm a developer at the BBC, and you'll find I like to talk a lot about Web standards, CSS, design systems and [Intrinsic Web Design](https://talks.jensimmons.com/GdnO62/everything-you-know-about-web-design-just-changed). I'll also share some of the talks I've done.
