Wow, you’re actually reading this! Hi! Thanks for checking out my blog.

I’m a Senior Software Engineer in the Design System team of the [BBC Product Group](https://careers.bbc.co.uk/content/What-We-Do/?locale=en_GB), based in MediaCityUK, Salford. We are rebuilding almost the entire UK website to work on a shared design system and a common framework and platform. It’s a fun job!

I’ve been a member of the [CSS Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) at the W3C since August 2024.

I am technically a full stack developer but really front-end who’s most interested in UX Engineering, Web Standards (especially CSS!), Intrinsic Web Design and accessibility!

I’m an alumnus of [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/) (class of 2016!), an amazing university by the sea, where I studied [Computer Science](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/).

I’m also a [Christian](https://talksat.withgoogle.com/talk/making-sense-of-god-an-invitation-to-the-skeptical), a member of [City Church Manchester](http://www.citychurchmanchester.org/), a <span lang="ja">日本語学習</span> (Japanese learner), a massive [Disney Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) fan and I think that [bourbon biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_biscuit) are better than custard creams!
